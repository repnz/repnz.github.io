      <description>I recommend to read the previous posts before reading this one:
 User APC API: We discussed the user mode API of user APC User APC Internals: We discussed the implementation of user APC in the kernel  Let&amp;rsquo;s continue our discussion about APC internals in windows: This time we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss APC dispatching in user mode and how APC works in Wow64 processes:
 The evolution of KiUserApcDispatcher Modifications to APC functions to support Wow64 Wow64 APC injection techniques  The evolution of KiUserApcDispatcher NTDLL contains a set of entry points that the kernel uses to run code in user mode like: KiUserExceptionDispatcher, KiUserCallbackDispatcher, &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Hey! This is the second part of the APC Series, If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it I recommend you to read the first post about User APC API. where I explore the internals of APC objects in Windows. In this part I&amp;rsquo;ll explain:
 How to queue user APCs from kernel mode? How user APCs are implemented in the windows kernel? How user APCs are delivered to user mode?  In this blog I won&amp;rsquo;t cover the internals of Special User APCs, because Special User APCs rely on Kernel APC to perform their operation - I&amp;rsquo;ll explore this type in a future post after I explain about Kernel APCs.</description>

      <description>Hey! Long time no see.
Coronavirus makes it harder for me to write posts, I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll have the time to write - I have a lot I want to share!
One of the things I did in the last few weeks is to explore the APC mechanism in Windows and I wanted to share some of my findings. The purpose of this series is to allow you to get a systematic understanding of APC internals.</description>

      <title>Dumping DPC Queues: Adventures in HIGH_LEVEL IRQL</title>
      <link>https://repnz.github.io/posts/practical-reverse-engineering/dumping-dpc-queues/</link>

      <description>This post is part of the Practical Reverse Engineering Exercises series.
To understand more about the basics of DPCs, read Reversing KeInsertQueueDpc
(Source code below.)
Exercise: Write a driver to enumerate all DPCs on the entire system. Make sure you support multi-processor systems! Explain the difficulties and how you solved them.
Sounds fun! let&amp;rsquo;s start. I thought about dividing this post to 2 posts, but nah
Using Undocumented APIs in Windows First of all, we need to understand that accessing the DPC queue from a real product is an extremely bad idea because it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty undocumented data structure.</description>

      <guid>https://repnz.github.io/posts/practical-reverse-engineering/reversing-dpc-keinsertqueuedpc/</guid>
      <description>Exercise:
Explain how the following functions work: KeInsertQueueDpc, KiRetireDpcList, KiExecuteDpc, and KiExecuteAllDpcs. If you feel like an overachiever, decompile those functions from the x86 and x64 assemblies and explain the differences.
If I want to explain the complete solution I&amp;rsquo;ll have to divide this exercise to 2 posts. The first post is pretty simple.. we are going to reverse engineer KeInsertQueueDpc. In future posts we&amp;rsquo;ll continue exploring DPC and we will write code that dumps the DPC queues.</description>

      <guid>https://repnz.github.io/posts/practical-reverse-engineering/query-module-information/</guid>
      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going over the solution to reverse engineering AuxKlibQueryModuleInformation. This exercise is one of the easiest exercises in the book.
Exercise:
In the walk-through, we mentioned that a driver can enumerate all loaded modules with the documented API AuxKlibQueryModuleInformation. Does this API guarantee that the returned module list is always up-to-date? Explain your answer. Next, reverse engineer AuxKlibQueryModuleInformation on Windows 8 and explain how it works. How does it handle the case when multiple threads are requesting access to the loaded module list?</description>

      <description>Hey, Here I save all the solutions to the windows kernel chapter of the practical reverse engineering book. The exercises in this book are pretty insightful.
The target audience of these posts are:
 People that want to read cool stuff about windows kernel reverse engineering People that want to learn how to break down reverse engineering tasks effeciently People that actually do the exercises and need a reference to the solutions.</description>

      <title>Abusing Signed Windows Drivers</title>
      <link>https://repnz.github.io/posts/abusing-signed-drivers/</link>

      <description>The Problem We all know the &amp;ldquo;Driver Signature Enforcement&amp;rdquo; feature in windows. This security feature won&amp;rsquo;t allow you to load unsigned drivers into the windows kernel. To bypass this protection, many attackers use vulnerable signed drivers like turla. They try to find vulnerabilities in these drivers and exploit them. What people don&amp;rsquo;t think about is the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s way simpler than finding an exploitable memory corruption bug in a software driver - sometimes the driver just exposes the functionality via DeviceIoControl and this can be used to perform malicious operations in kernel mode.</description>

      <title>Autochk Rootkit Analysis</title>

      <description>Introduction Finally had time to write about this rootkit I saw last week. This rootkit is a very simple, it does not employ any uber fancy methods or something, but I do find it nice so I wanted to share. The name of the driver is &amp;ldquo;autochk.sys&amp;rdquo; - that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;ll call it the autochk rootkit. The sample is already known (28924b6329f5410a5cca30f3530a3fb8a97c23c9509a192f2092cbdf139a91d8), but I haven&amp;rsquo;t found any public analysis. The rootkit was compiled on the 27/8/2017 according to the PE timestamp.</description>

      <description>Found this funny driver: The pdc.sys windows driver has a DriverUnload routine but it calls KeBugCheckEx causing a bluescreen.
Just run &amp;quot;sc stop pdc&amp;quot; and see for yourself ;)
I wonder why they registered DriverUnload if the driver does not support unload.. ðŸ¤” pic.twitter.com/TNpKIZGvZX
