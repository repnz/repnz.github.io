      <description>The Problem We all know the &amp;ldquo;Driver Signature Enforcement&amp;rdquo; feature in windows. This security feature won&amp;rsquo;t allow you to load unsigned drivers into the windows kernel. To bypass this protection, many attackers use vulnerable signed drivers like turla. They try to find vulnerabilities in these drivers and exploit them. What people don&amp;rsquo;t think about is the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s way simpler than finding an exploitable memory corruption bug in a software driver - sometimes the driver just exposes the functionality via DeviceIoControl and this can be used to perform malicious operations in kernel mode.</description>

      <title>Autochk Rootkit Analysis</title>

      <description>Introduction Finally had time to write about this rootkit I saw last week. This rootkit is a very simple, it does not employ any uber fancy methods or something, but I do find it nice so I wanted to share. The name of the driver is &amp;ldquo;autochk.sys&amp;rdquo; - that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;ll call it the autochk rootkit. The sample is already known (28924b6329f5410a5cca30f3530a3fb8a97c23c9509a192f2092cbdf139a91d8), but I haven&amp;rsquo;t found any public analysis. The rootkit was compiled on the 27/8/2017 according to the PE timestamp.</description>

      <description>Found this funny driver: The pdc.sys windows driver has a DriverUnload routine but it calls KeBugCheckEx causing a bluescreen.
Just run &amp;quot;sc stop pdc&amp;quot; and see for yourself ;)
I wonder why they registered DriverUnload if the driver does not support unload.. ðŸ¤” pic.twitter.com/TNpKIZGvZX
