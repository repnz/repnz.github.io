      <title>Abusing Signed Windows Drivers</title>

      <description>The Problem We all know the &amp;ldquo;Driver Signature Enforcement&amp;rdquo; feature in windows. This security feature won&amp;rsquo;t allow you to load unsigned drivers into the windows kernel. To bypass this protection, many attackers use vulnerable signed drivers like turla. They try to find vulnerabilities in these drivers and exploit them. What people don&amp;rsquo;t think about is the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s way simpler than finding an exploitable memory corruption bug in a software driver - sometimes the driver just exposes the functionality via DeviceIoControl and this can be used to perform malicious operations in kernel mode.</description>

      <title>Autochk Rootkit Analysis</title>

      <description>Introduction Finally had time to write about this rootkit I saw last week. This rootkit is a very simple, it does not employ any uber fancy methods or something, but I do find it nice so I wanted to share. The name of the driver is &amp;ldquo;autochk.sys&amp;rdquo; - that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;ll call it the autochk rootkit. The sample is already known (28924b6329f5410a5cca30f3530a3fb8a97c23c9509a192f2092cbdf139a91d8), but I haven&amp;rsquo;t found any public analysis. The rootkit was compiled on the 27/8/2017 according to the PE timestamp.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the windows kernel, each kernel object has a Query/SetInformation functions which can be used to
manipulate the kernel objects members from user/kernel mode. These functions receive an &amp;ldquo;INFOCLASS&amp;rdquo;
which is basically the member we want to modify/query.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
